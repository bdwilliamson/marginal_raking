## Motivation

We are often missing data on some people:
* traditional missing data
* two-phase studies (missing data by design)
* Electronic health records 

Traditional methods require correct outcome model and either
* correct missing-data model (inverse probability weighting)
* correct imputation model (multiple imputation)

Here, we consider estimators that are consistent under weaker conditions

## Data structure and notation

Outcome: $Y$

(binary) Exposure or treatment: $X$ 

--

Covariates measured on full cohort: $Z$

Covariates subject to missingness: $W$

Indicator of complete data: $R$

--

Ideal data $(Y,X,Z,W) \sim \mathbb{P}_0$

Observed data $(Y, X, Z, R, RW) \sim P_0$

---

## Estimating a regression parameter with missing data

Suppose our interest is in estimating $\beta_1$ from model $$E(Y \mid X = x, Z = z, W = w) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + [z, w] \alpha$$

--

Classical estimator: inverse probability of coarsening-weighted (IPW) estimator

--

Probability of observing $W$: $\pi_0(y,x,z) = E_0(R \mid Y = y, X = x, Z = z)$

Suppose $U(\beta)$ is the ideal-data estimating equation

IPW estimator: 
1. Obtain estimator $\pi_{n,IPW}(y,x,z)$ of $\pi_0$ (using, e.g., logistic regression)
2. Solve IPW estimating equation: $$0 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i}{\pi_{n,IPW}(Y_i, X_i, Z_i)}U(\hat{\beta}_{1,IPW})$$ (using, e.g., `glm` in `R`)

---

## Generalized raking

If $\pi_{n,IPW}$ is consistent, then $\hat{\beta}_{1,IPW}$ is consistent

What if $\pi_{n,IPW}$ is not consistent?

--

Idea: adjust the weights to increase robustness

For a distance measure $d$, 
\begin{align*}
  \pi_{n,GR,i} =& \ a_i \pi_{n,IPW,i} \\
  a =& \ \min_{b \in \mathbb{R}^n} \sum_{i=1}^n R_i d(b_i \pi_{n,IPW,i}^{-1}, \pi_{n,IPW,i}^{-1}) \\
  & \ \text{subject to} \sum_{i = 1}^n h_i = \sum_{i = 1}^n R_i b_i h_i \pi_{n,IPW,i}^{-1},
\end{align*}
where $h$ is a vector of the estimated efficient influence functions for the regression parameters

Then, solve estimating equation: $$0 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i}{\pi_{n,GR}(Y_i, X_i, Z_i)}U(\hat{\beta}_{1,GR})$$ 

---

## Generalized raking

Shown to be equivalent to the optimal augmented IPW (AIPW) estimator [Lumley et al. (2011), Robins et al. (1994)]

Implemented in software: `R` `survey` package [Lumley (2004)]

The generalized raking estimator is _asymptotically linear_: we can write 
\begin{align*}
  \sqrt{n}(\hat{\beta}_{1,GR} - \beta_1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_\beta(Y_i, X_i, Z_i, W_i) + o_P(1)
\end{align*}

Inference for $\beta_1$ can be carried out using the influence function $\phi_\beta$
* for glms, $\phi_\beta = I(\beta)^{-1}\dot{\ell}_\beta(y, x,z,w)$
* $I$ is the Fisher information
* $\dot{\ell}$ is the score

## Marginal estimands

Now, interest is in a .blue1[marginal] estimand

Examples:
* Treatment-specific mean: $\mu_x = E\{E(Y \mid X = x, Z, W)\}$
* Average treatment effect (ATE): $ATE = \mu_1 - \mu_0$
* With binary outcomes:
  * risk difference (RD) = ATE
  * relative risk (RR): $RR = \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_0}$

Often of interest in causal inference, safety and efficacy studies

## Using traditional generalized raking

How do we estimate the ATE using traditional raking?

1. Estimate $\pi_{n,IPW}$ using, e.g., logistic regression
2. Calibrate weights*, obtain $\pi_{n,GR}$
3. Fit weighted outcome regression model, obtain $Q_n$ (using, e.g., linear regression)
4. Estimate treatment-specific means $$\mu_{x,n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i}{\pi_{n,GR,i}}Q_n(x, Z_i, W_i)$$
5. Plug in treatment-specific means to estimate ATE: $ATE_n = \mu_{1,n} - \mu_{0,n}$
6. Inference can be carried out using the delta method

* using influence functions for regression parameters

---

## Marginal generalized raking

Traditional raking is doubly robust: consistent if either 
* estimator $Q_n$ of $Q(x,z,w) = E(Y \mid X = x, Z = z, W = w)$ is consistent, or
* estimator $\pi_n$ of $\pi = E(R \mid X = x, Z = z, Y = y)$ is consistent

The theory for traditional raking relies on .blue1[parametric models]
* $Q_n$ and $\pi_n$ could be inconsistent in complex models

--

idea 1: use machine learning to gain robustness

idea 2: target marginal estimand to gain efficiency over delta method

## Using marginal generalized raking

How do we estimate the ATE using marginal raking?

1. Estimate $\pi_{n,IPW}$ using, e.g., logistic regression or machine learning
2. Calibrate weights*, obtain $\pi_{n,GR}$
3. Fit weighted outcome regression model, obtain $Q_n$ (using, e.g., machine learning)
4. Estimate treatment-specific means $$\mu_{x,n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i}{\pi_{n,GR,i}}Q_n(x, Z_i, W_i)$$
5. Plug in treatment-specific means to estimate ATE: $ATE_n = \mu_{1,n} - \mu_{0,n}$
6. Inference can be carried out using influence functions

* using influence function for estimand of interest

Influence functions for common estimands (e.g., ATE, RR) well-studied

## Simulation

Estimators to compare:
1. traditional raking
2. marginal raking using semiparametric influence function
3. marginal raking using nonparametric influence function

Data: 
* four continuous covariates $(Z_1, Z_2)$, $(W_1, W_2)$
* missing data probability 40%

Scenarios:
1. continuous outcome
2. binary outcome with $P(Y = 1) = 0.25$

Simple outcome model and missing-data model

## Results - continuous outcome

```{r sim-results-continuous, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width="100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/sim_combined_performance_plot_s9.png"))
```

---

## Results - binary outcome

```{r sim-results-binary, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width="100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/sim_combined_performance_plot_s1.png"))
```

## Closing thoughts

In simple scenarios, all estimators perform similarly

In more complex scenarios, nonparametric marginal raking expected to be more robust than traditional raking
